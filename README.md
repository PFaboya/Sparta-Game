# Sparta-Game

## Summary

The task here was to make a game that can be played online using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game had to include instructions on how to play the game and in this case display the user's score.

## Hunting Season

The game is called Hunting season, a simple shooting gallery game where the aim is to shoot the deer to gain points (each deer is worth 10 points). The deers slide out of their hiding spot and will disappear if shot or left alone for too long, they do reappear however. The final part was to ensure everything is at random as possible, so when the deer disappear and reappear is random to add extra challenge to the game.
